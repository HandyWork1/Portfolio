    <h3>BACKGROUND</h3>
    <p>My name is Khalil and I've actually started my <strong>bachelor's degree in computer science</strong> and aiming on completing it as fast as I can to move on to greener pastures.
    I haven't done much with my life yet but I'm planning to leave a legacy behind when I'm gone. I also do not have any job experience in a relevant field but I've been working as a clerk at a <strong>distributor</strong>.
    <br>I actually fell in love with programming very early on life, wanting to know how programs were made, I obviously didnt know what programming was but I was curious and that has brought me to where I am today and I'm loving every moment of it.</p>
    <h3>HOBBIES</h3>
    <p> I have quite the passion in learn about software development and just IT in general.I've quite a number of hobbies when I'm not trying to code. I  will start by mentioning my favourite of hobbies that always gets me going is football and I'd like to believe I'm pretty good at it.
    Some of my other hobbies include swimming, chess(always freshens my mind), basketball and quite recently table-tennis</p>
